# Code-Refactor-1-Homework
In this project I must refactor the given HTML and CSS code, to make it accessible and clean. In order to achieve this, I have followed the Scout rule.

According to the expectations of the agency, I have added the correct syntax and semantics to the HTML and CSS files, making it easier to understand, by following the standard rules for semantic elements in HTML. Also I have cleaned up the CSS file in order to make it more organized and easy to read, keeping in mind the accessibility needed for this specific project.

I have followed the criteria provided by the agency, by resolving issues one by one as outlined in the project. Also I added the corresponding notes on the HTML and CSS file, for every specific change that I did, in order to make it easy to comprehend and read.
